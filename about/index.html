            <h1>Why choose TidesX?</h1>
            While there are other tide information apps available, they look dated and feel clunky and slow. TidesX was created to provide a beautiful yet functional alternative to these old apps. Built with state-of-the-art and modern web technologies, TidesX is not only fast and reliable but also offers a download size a fraction of those of its rivals thanks to our use of next-generation technologies such as Trusted Web Activites.

            <h1>How does TidesX work?</h1>
            Every time you look for accurate tidal information on TidesX, we send a request straight to the UK Hydrographic Office to obtain the most up-to-date tidal predictions for today and the week ahead. These are sent to your device in an average of just 100ms, more than twice as fast as other available tide times apps.
